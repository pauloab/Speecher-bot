# Speecher-bot
A DIscord bot that use Text to speech and play some personal audios

## How does it work?

This bot uses Discord.py to connect with discord API, gTTS to convert text-to-speech using google API, and other API to use external voices with a daily limit.

Also can play some mp3 audios from the audio/ folder and convert it into commands starting with the !, for example !coco refering to the coco.mp3 audio. 

As a bonus, it can play Youtube videos as audio using youtube_dl, but then, it cannot play audios or use tts at the same time.

## Can I use it?

Short answer, no.

Long answer, no... It started as a joke and have tons of bugs right now. I'm still developing it, so by the moment, don't use it.

## So...

I'll add more documentation later, now I'm going to take a nap, start to fix bugs and things like that :).
